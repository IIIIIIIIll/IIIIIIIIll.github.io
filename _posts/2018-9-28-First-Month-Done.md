It's been a month! I didn't actually feel it until I finished the first monthly exam yesterday. I have spent another 1/12 year of my life in return of some knowledge. However, I do feel a bit strange, that feeling of inconsistency still bothers me from time to time. What am I exactly doing here? Should I setup a goal? Anyways, that would be an issue for some other days, still have some projects and exams to do.

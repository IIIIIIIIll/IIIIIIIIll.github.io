It's now 30 degrees celsius everyday now. I wonder what gonna be like in July and August. Also, for the research part we are doing fine. We are now even try to apply the most recent innovations onto our systems. Honestly we are still far far away from the promised autonomous future. But we will be there, in my opinion in a very short amount of time.

It is the last day of class(for me) of junior year. I can't believe I really travelled this far. The days of high school seem to just passed and I am still that young teenager. But I acknowledge everything has changed, I started to think of getting a master degree and, more importantly, I feel that sense of explorer coming back to me. Maybe after the three years of wondering I am coming back to who I am? The everlasting itchy is pulling me back to the infinite seas.

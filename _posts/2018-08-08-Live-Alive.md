I don't usually consider myself as an Otaku, but there do exists a few animations that I just can't resist. 涼宮ハルヒの憂鬱 is one, the dearest dream in the first ten years of the 21st century, the best story ever been written by a Japanese, the first so called "light novel" that was been made into a animation, the eterneal dream of 100 million fans. Now is really the best time in a year to watch it(it's never-ending august)

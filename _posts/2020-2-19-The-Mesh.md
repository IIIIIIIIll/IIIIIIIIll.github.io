I recently read a book, a book about telegrams. In that "altered history novel" it mentions something interesting. A wedding by the telegrams, it is believed to happen around mid 19th century. "Hundreds of greetings come from the lanes, I felt the world is greeting me". That sounds extremely familiar, like the good old times where people are still partying like it's 1999.

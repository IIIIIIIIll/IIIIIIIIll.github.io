It's been two weeks since the last post and I was having a lot of trouble in the past few days primarily caused by airline delays and the unacceptable housing condition. But anyways, I have now settled and ready for muy junior year. I believe I will have a lot of fun this year since I'm taking a lot of interesting classes.
ps: I also got a credit card, but I don't know how to use it in a more efficient manner....

So here I am at the southern part of China, I came here mainly for the RoboMasters hosted by DJI Innovation.
One of my best friends in high school is competing. I also have something on my bucket-list, 华强北. The heaven of geeks and people who are still in electronic fever.
I will make another post about the pictures I took during the trip.
One more thing, I was trying to find a FujiFilm ACE460 one-time use film camera but they might just go extincted here.

Written in GuangZhou, China, the heart of light-industry.

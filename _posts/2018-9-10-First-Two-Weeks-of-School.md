HoHoHo, it's been two weeks since the start of the school and I'm going to have the first career fair in my life. Nervous, a little bit, I don't typically want to work in the United States, I want to go explore the world a bit. Working in different countries and meet different cultures. Limit myself in United States is certainly not desirable. Maybe europe, such as Finland, Poland, and Czech. I have dreamed about working in  places like these fantastic countries since I was little, maybe 6 years old?

PS: I had an allergy last week(maybe shrimp) and the temperature dropped about 15 celsius in one day....

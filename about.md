I have been trying to make a personal website for a long time, probably 2 or 3 years. But for different reasons (like laziness, laziness, and laziness), not until now I finally decide to finish it.

So, I am student major in CompSci in Lehigh University, a quite small but good school in Bethlehem, PA, US. I was born in Nanjing, China.

I will add more details later.

It's a pleasure to meet with you.

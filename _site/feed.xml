One of my best friends in high school is competing. I also have something on my bucket-list, 华强北. The heaven of geeks and people who are still in electronic fever.
I will make another post about the pictures I took during the trip.
One more thing, I was trying to find a FujiFilm ACE460 one-time use film camera but they might just go extincted here.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a Fuji X-T100. APS-C Bayer Array sensor with the new 15-45 len. It’s pretty much a XA-5 in a XT-20 body, but I need EVF anyways so I don’t have much choices. I will use this to shot some nice pictures during my summer.&lt;/p&gt;
